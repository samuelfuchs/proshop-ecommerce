# Proshop (ecommerce)

This project was really fun to do! I learned a ton of new information that encouraged me to learn more backend technologies.

This online shop is built on JavaScript, using the MERN Stack:
- MongoDb
- ExpressJs
- ReactJs
- NodeJs

This project contains: authentication, review system, propper routing, 404 page, Bootstrap layout, admin right, create products, delete products, delete database, create new users, give administration rights to users, payment methods (Striper, PayPal), API tested with Postman.
